## Primary Contributions

#### A Gaier, A Asteroth, JB Mouret, 2018: "Data-efficient Design Exploration Through Surrogate-assisted Illumination" _Evolutionary Computation_ ([PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05865))
  * The paper of record for the Surrogate-Assisted Illumination (SAIL) algorithm, an approach which integrates quality-diversity and Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process models to create a data-efficient method of producing large archives of diverse solutions. Building on work done in conference publications, aerodynamic problems are tackled -- illustrating the techniques ability to extend the reach of quality-diversity algorithms to even computationally expensive domains.
  * Preliminary work introducing the approach received the Best Paper award (Complex Systems) at the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) 2017 -- the premier conference for evolutionary computation. A paper pplying the approach received the Best Student Paper award at the AIAA/ISSMO Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization Conference, part of the AIAA Forum -- the largest event for aerospace research. 
  * Impact: _Evolutionary Computation_ (impact factor 2019: 3.826) is one of the top journals in the field of evolutionary computation. Since its publication one year ago this paper has been cited across a wide range of fields including robot learning, additive manufacturing, aerodynamics optimization, and procedural video game content generation.
  
 
#### A Gaier, A Asteroth, JB Mouret, 2018: "Data-Efficient Neuroevolution with Kernel-Based Surrogate Models" _Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)_ ([PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05364))
  * We introduced a method of predicting the performance of evolved neural networks using Gaussian process models and a custom kernel which efficiently computes a hereditary distance between solutions. Integrating this model into a surrogate-assisted optimization framework we improved the data-efficiency of a state-of-the-art neuroevolution algorithm by several times.
  * Impact: This work received the Best Paper award (Complex Systems) at (GECCO) 2018 -- the premier conference for evolutionary computation
  
#### A Gaier, D Ha, 2019: "Weight Agnostic Neural Networks" ([Interactive Article](https://weightagnostic.github.io/), [PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04358)) 
  * In this paper we question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. A search method was proposed for neural network architectures that can already perform a task without any explicit weight training. We demonstrated that our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised learning domain, we found network architectures that achieve much higher than chance accuracy on MNIST (>90\%) using random weights.
  * Awaiting review. 
  * Impact: Has already generated [substantial conversation](https://twitter.com/hardmaru/status/1138600152048910336) in the machine-learning community, including discussions in journal clubs in the [US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmniHm9Fk-A) and [China](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/71848261).

#### A Gaier, A Asteroth 2014: "Evolving Look-ahead Controllers for Energy Optimal Driving and Path Planning" _Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications (INISTA)_ ([PDF](https://bit.ly/2Kxp1je))
  * An evolved neural network controller was presented to solve the optimal control problem for energy optimal driving of low power-to-mass vehicles. Controller computes equivalent control commands to traditional graph searching approaches, while able to adapt to varied constraints and conditions. After training, as trivial amounts of computation time and memory are required, the approach is suitable for use in embedded systems and path planning applications.
  * Impact: Along with preliminary work _Evolution of optimal control for energy-efficient transport_ received the Drive-E Studienpreis for outstanding student work. The Drive-E Studienpreis is national award given by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the Fraunhofer Society, and the German automotive industry.
