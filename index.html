<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>I'm a nomadic American researcher with a research  background spanning <b>{evolutionary computation, robotics,</b> and <b>machine learning</b>. I mostly work in biologically-inspired computation with <b>neuroevolution</b>, <b>quality-diversity</b>, and <b>novelty-based approaches</b>. Concentrated on <b>integration of evolutionary and ML</b> techniques in doctoral research -- with particular application to <b>real-world design</b> and control problems. Fascinated by questions of creativity, embodiment, and innateness in machine intelligence.
  
  My name Yuyin Zhou, currently a 3rd-year PhD student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, advised by <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/">Dr. Alan Yuille</a>.
  My research interests are computer vision and medical image analysis. I am a member of <a href="http://ccvl.jhu.edu/">Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning (CCVL)</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, I obtained M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering department at UCLA in 2016.</p>
