<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>I'm a nomadic American researcher with a research  background spanning <b>evolutionary computation, robotics,</b> and <b>machine learning</b>. I mostly work in and around biologically-inspired computation with <b>neuroevolution</b>, <b>quality-diversity</b>, and <b>novelty-based approaches</b>.</p>

<p>My doctoral work centers on the <b>integration of evolutionary and ML</b> techniques -- with particular application to <b>real-world design</b> and control problems -- but am fascinated by questions of creativity, embodiment, and innateness in machine intelligence.
